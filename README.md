A BioHack project - Food Safety Solutions with Biomarkers, Sensors and Dispensers
In this project I aim to make a fresh greens storage and transport system that conserves the integrety (prevents from spoilage and or contamination) of the produce by monitoring the level of a coloured biomarker and reacting against the contamination by spraying the produce with baterial inhibitor.

This will involve the following research and experimental streams
1. Microbiology: Selection, Study and Culturing of Microorganism to be used as biomarker. I.E. Bioluminescent indicator or Color Indicator? How to make the idicator species resistant to the bacterial contamination inhibitor? How to coat produce with enough indicator species?
2. Design of Storage Container: 3D CAD drawing and material cutting and assembling. Determine properties required for container i.e. size limit, shape, ventilation, powering mode, isulation and or isolation mechanisms.
3. Design of Control Mechanisms: Input Type (bioluminescence levels? - if so, threshold? must be in dark environment? what kind of sensor to be used?, color levels? - if so, similar qts as for bioluminescence). QT: Do the biomarkers really have to be color/luminescent? - YES! Because they need to be visible to humans. Coding and testing for input information thresholds and for output information reactions - i.e. Spray with inhibitor, lower temperature?
4. Testing and optimising the whole system
